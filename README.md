# Machine-Learning-Models

1. Movie Recommeder System (Content-Based):
   Using the dataset from Kaggle, built a movie recommndation engine in Jupyter notebook.
   Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, NLTK(For Word Stemming), Scikit-Learn.

   Initially, data was pre-processed as per the need and then stemmed using NLTK then a  ML model was bulit for vecotrised parameters of the data. Entering a movie name would give a list of 5 similar movie names from the dataset.
