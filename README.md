# Machine-Learning-Models

1. **Movie Recommeder System (Content-Based):**
   
   Using the dataset from Kaggle, built a movie recommndation engine in Jupyter notebook.
   Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, NLTK(For Word Stemming), Scikit-Learn.

   Initially, data was pre-processed as per the need and then stemmed using NLTK then a  ML model was bulit for vecotrised
   parameters of the data. Entering a movie name would give a list of 5 similar movie names from the dataset. 

3. **Classificaton (Naive Bayes) - SMS Spam Classifier:**

   Using the dataset from Kaggle, built a Spam Classifier in Jupyter notebook.
   Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, NLTK(For Word Stemming), Scikit-Learn, wordCloud, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

   Initially, data was pre-processed as per the need and then stemmed using NLTK then a  ML model was bulit for vecotrised             parameters of the data. Acheived an Accuracy of above 90% and a precision of 1.0 with Multinomial Naive Bayes.
